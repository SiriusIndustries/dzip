# dzip
A simple tool for comparing the difference between ZIP archives.

### Installation
0. Ensure you have NodeJS installed on your system and added to your PATH as normal.
1. Run ``npm i -g @siriusindustries/dzip`` or ``pnpm i -g @siriusindustries/dzip`` or ``yarn global add @siriusindustries/dzip`` to install.
2. Run ``dzip <first archive> <second archive>`` to view the difference between the archives.

### Notes
Other kinds of ZIP archives, such as JARs, are supported by this tool - it does not function based on the file extension.
